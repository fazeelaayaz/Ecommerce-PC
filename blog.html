  <div class="container build-info-text">
    <h3 class="my-3">CPU</h3>
    <img src="img/blog/CPU.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded cpu-img" alt="...">
    <p class="display-6 fs-5 my-3 text-break lh-lg">
      When it comes to building a PC, choosing the right CPU is a critical decision. The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the powerhouse of your system, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. 
      It's like the brain that drives the overall performance and speed of your computer. The CPU's performance is determined by factors such as the number of cores, clock speed, and cache size. 
      Multiple cores enable efficient multitasking and smoother execution of demanding applications. Clock speed, measured in gigahertz (GHz), indicates how fast the CPU can process instructions.
    </p>
    <h3 class="my-3">Motherboard</h3>
    <img src="img/blog/Motherboard.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
    <p class="display-6 fs-5 my-3 text-break lh-lg">
      The motherboard is the backbone of your PC, connecting and coordinating all the crucial components. It's like a command center that enables seamless communication between the CPU, memory, storage, graphics card, and other peripherals.
      When it comes to choosing a motherboard for your PC build, there are a few key factors to consider. First, make sure the motherboard is compatible with your chosen CPU socket type. 
      This ensures proper fitment and functionality. The motherboard should also have sufficient expansion slots and connectors to accommodate your desired components, such as graphics cards, storage drives, and RAM modules.
    </p>
    <h3 class="my-3">GPU</h3>
    <img src="img/blog/GPU.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
    <p class="display-6 fs-5 my-3 text-break lh-lg">
      The GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is an essential component for any PC build, especially for gaming and graphics-intensive tasks. 
      The GPU is responsible for rendering and displaying images, videos, and animations on your monitor. When choosing a GPU, consider factors such as performance, compatibility, and budget. 
      The performance of a GPU is determined by its core clock speed, memory capacity, and architecture. 
      Higher core clock speeds and larger memory capacities generally result in better performance. 
      It's important to ensure that the GPU is compatible with your motherboard and power supply unit (PSU) in terms of physical size and power requirements.
    </p>
    <h3 class="my-3">RAM</h3>
    <img src="img/blog/RAM.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
    <p class="display-6 fs-5 my-3 text-break lh-lg">
      When selecting RAM for your PC build, there are a few key considerations. First, determine the amount of RAM you need based on your specific requirements. 
      Gaming and content creation tasks generally benefit from larger amounts of RAM, while everyday computing can function well with smaller capacities. Next, consider the RAM's speed, which is measured in megahertz (MHz). 
      Higher speeds allow for faster data transfer between the RAM and CPU, resulting in improved performance. However, it's important to ensure that the RAM speed is compatible with your motherboard's supported frequencies
    </p>
    <h3 class="my-3">Storage</h3>
    <img src="img/blog/SSD.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
    <p class="display-6 fs-5 my-3 text-break lh-lg">
      Storage is a crucial component when it comes to building a PC, as it determines the capacity and speed at which you can store and access your data. There are several options available for PC storage, each with its own benefits and considerations.
      Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) offer large storage capacities at affordable prices. Solid State Drives (SSDs) have gained popularity due to their faster data transfer speeds and improved overall system performance. 
      For maximum performance, some PC builders opt for a combination of SSD and HDD storage. 
      They use an SSD as the primary drive for the operating system and essential applications, while using an HDD for bulk storage of less frequently accessed files.
    </p>
    <h3 class="my-3">Cases</h3>
    <img src="img/blog/case.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="...">
    <p class="display-6 fs-5 my-3 text-break lh-lg">
      The PC case is not just a housing for your components; it also plays a crucial role in the overall functionality, aesthetics, and cooling of your build. When selecting a case for your PC build, there are several factors to consider.
      First, consider the form factor of the case. Common form factors include ATX, Micro ATX, and Mini-ITX. Next, consider the airflow and cooling options of the case. Another important consideration is the number and placement of drive bays.
      Cable management is also crucial for a clean and organized build. Aesthetics and personal preferences also come into play. 
      Lastly, don't forget about additional features such as front panel ports (USB, audio), dust filters, tool-less installation, and any other conveniences that can enhance your building and usage experience.

      Cooling is a critical aspect of PC building to ensure that your components operate within safe temperature ranges and maintain optimal performance. There are two primary methods of cooling: air cooling and liquid cooling.
      Air cooling typically involves using fans and heatsinks to dissipate heat generated by the CPU, GPU, and other components.
      Liquid cooling, also known as water cooling, is a more advanced cooling solution that uses a closed-loop system or custom loops to circulate liquid coolant.
